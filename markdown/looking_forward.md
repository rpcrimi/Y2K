# Looking Forward

> "Hindsight is always 20/20"

Looking back on the Y2K problem, it seems obvious that developers should have acknowledge the changing millennium in their software systems. However, most developers at the time believed that their systems would be obsolete by the year 2000 and unfortunately, this decision came back to bite them. When designing a software system, it is crucial to take into account any formatting or standard that could change over time. 

Looking into the future, we can foresee a few other Y2K-like problems. For example, the Unix systems `time_t` date type calculates the total number of seconds elapsed from January 1st, 1970. For a 32-bit system, this value will not be able to be stored as it will exceed 2^31-1 bits. Another example, while loosely related to computer science, is the fact that at some point, the US will run out of 9-digit social security numbers. It is important to begin to think about how we will transition social security numbers before this time arrives.
